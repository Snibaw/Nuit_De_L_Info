# Nuit_De_L_Info
 
"La Nuit de l'info" is a programming event whose goal is to create a web application in one night. For this, we were composed of a team of 6 and had to program on the theme of sexually transmitted diseases. I was in charge of the programming of the web page while others were in charge of the drawings or the scenario. Thanks to this event, I was able to discover Flask and get familiar with it, while developing my teamwork. Unfortunately, due to a registration problem we had to stop before the end of the night but here is a picture of our web game.
